    <string name="about">

        India has one of the largest and diverse education systems in the world.
        Privatization, widespread expansion, increased autonomy and introduction of Programmes in new and emerging areas
        have improved access to higher education. At the same time, it has also led to widespread concern on the quality
        and relevance of the higher education. To address these concerns, the National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986) and
        the Programme of Action (PoA, 1992) spelt out strategic plans for the policies, advocated the establishment of an
        independent National accreditation agency. Consequently, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC)
        was established in 1994 as an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission (UGC) with its Head Quarter
        in Bengaluru. The mandate of NAAC as reflected in its vision statement is in making quality assurance an integral
        part of the functioning of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).

    <string name="grievance">

        he NAAC views the process of assessment and accreditation as an exercise in partnership, done jointly by the
        NAAC and the institution being assessed. Every stage of the process is marked by transparency. The institution is
        consulted at various stages of the process â€“ eliminating conflict of interest with the peers, planning the visit
        schedule, sharing the draft peer team report before the team leaves the campus etc. In spite of this participatory
        approach, there may be institutions that might have grievances to be addressed. Therefore, to provide a review
        mechanism for institutions who are aggrieved about the process or its outcome or
        any other issues related thereof, the NAAC has evolved Grievance Redressal Guidelines.\n

        On announcement of the A and A outcome, the institution not satisfied with the accreditation status may submit:\n

    1) The letter of intent for appeal along with a request to provide the criterion wise scores so as to reach NAAC within 30 days from the receipt of the letter intimating the accreditation status from NAAC.\n
    2 )The application for Appeal in the format prescribed by NAAC (refer Grievance Redressal Guidelines) should reach NAAC within 30 days from the date of receipt of the criterion wise scores from NAAC. The application for appeal should be submitted along with  the requisite non-refundable fee of Rs. 1,00,000/- plus service tax (GST @ 18%).\n
